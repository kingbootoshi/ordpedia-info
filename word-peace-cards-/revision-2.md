## What are World Peace Cards? 🌎☮️
World Peace Cards are a collection of digital art cards inspired by Gizmo, and Puppet. These cards are designed to reflect the essence of World Peace through creative and diverse artistic expressions.

The collection was first fostered by [@viva_la_vandal](https://x.com/viva_la_vandal), who played a key role in bringing this vision to life. Created by an incredible lineup of artists from across the space, each drop features small batches of unique artwork that embody the values of World Peace. 🌎☮️
