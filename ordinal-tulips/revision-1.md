Below is an article written about the project that at one point was believed to be the "best art" on ordinals at the time.

THE BLOCKCHAIN FULL OF TULIPS
Born in early February 2023 inscribed in the Bitcoin blockchain, these Tulips can be the best "art" in the sub10k inscription of ordinals.

Cryptocurrencies have been existing for more than a decade led by Bitcoin. The coin, $BTC, has grown tremendously and the NFT space was disrupted when ordinals came in late January. As $BTC is considered as the grail of crypto currencies, ordinals started to flourish as more people flocked in to inscribed their pieces and projects grinding to achieve the first mover advantage.
Still a first-mover and not too late to the party.
Tulip's first inscription is at #5478. The space perceived sub10k as the best ordinal entry in the early days and this caught attention bringing new people in ordinals. Project was minted out fast and it quickly mooned to around 0.15btc (2.1eth) as of this writing.
Noteworthy art deviating from PFPs.
Most sub10k projects are PFPs and people love them. However, value will always prevail in great art and Tulips could be the grail of ordinal art in this inscription range. The world is slowly moving into digital art and it will just be a matter of time that most galleries will feature historical art and Tulips could be the best candidate. Project is still on its early stage and the space has yet to hear narratives and lores on these tulips. But once it happens, it will be interesting.
Low supply and low community engagement
This could be a make-or-break for the project. It only has 100 supplies and this may not help the volume, hence, visibility of the project maybe compromised. After all Tulips had been minted out, the engagement within the community started to vanish. However, this could be due to diamond-holding of holders and the high barrier of entry FP-wise. When the volume of ordinals picks up, especially with the emergence of new and sought-after projects on high inscription IDs, the sub10k projects will surely follow the tide and these Tulips will, once again, become visible.
INSIGHTS
Tulip's floor rose tremendously in the past 3 weeks. A week ago, people were selling these at 0.07-0.10btc a piece. Now, bids are around 0.175bt with asking price in the marketplaces at 0.30btc.
