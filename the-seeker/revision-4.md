# What is The Seeker?

At its heart, The Seeker is an **open-source sci-fi universe** ‚Äî a world based around the passions of its creators: cosmic horror, mathematics and philosophy.

It began 2 years ago with a game: a metroidvania adventure where everything ‚Äî code, assets, music ‚Äî is open source. Explore an alien world where mathematical precision shapes every element, from visuals to soundscapes. But all this is just one piece of a larger vision...


The Seeker is much more than just a game. It's an open blueprint that can be used to create any kind of product 'in the style of The Seeker'. You can think of it as an 'open source brand' which utilizes Ordinals to capture brand value without restricting anyone's freedom to experiment with it.

Some examples of projects we've built / currently working on:
- Sci-fi [video game](https://x.com/TheSeekerGame/status/1872785822875041855) ('main' project)
- Tabletop RPG expanding on the Universe created for the game
- Audiovisual art series built on our soundtrack ('[Plasmatics](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/plasmatics)' by TCB)
- Music label with tracks based on our unique mathematical tunings
- [Seeker Capsules](https://x.com/TheSeekerGame/status/1848330835616845950) (real world airdrops of seed phrases etched in steel)
- Tools for Rare Sat collectors ([.prime-seeker](https://x.com/TheSeekerGame/status/1853509323889987667))
- Physical collectibles / merch / clothing
- Collaborations with great artists from Ordinals and beyond

The project has been designed from the ground up to achieve a perfect **synergy with AI**. In the 'AI age' the real value lies in deep, coherent ideas. AI will soon be able to turn any prompt into an infinite suite of products, and at a fundamental level The Seeker is just a really good prompt - with years of work and thought dedicated to make it incredibly deep and coherent. 
Any new product generated using our creative blueprint automatically inherits all this depth.

# Collections

The project has 3 core collections, each serving a unique purpose within the ecosystem:
- **[The Seeker [üëÅÔ∏è]:](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/the-seeker)** Our small OG collection which documents and timestamps the project's evolution on the world's most secure ledger, starting with the first 16 inscriptions in the Sub10K club. The sole purpose of this collection is preserving our story in an immutable way.
- **[Planetary Primes [ü™ê]:](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/planetaryprimes)** Community access tokens that drive deflationary value and ecosystem participation. Most new things we create (as well as many pieces from the OG collection) can be purchased exclusively with Planetary Primes. This creates a deflationary pressure and links the collection's value to the growth of the project. While the Primes themselves are the first ever collection on Prime Number sats, some of them have also been 'reinscribed' with new smaller collections that in turn drive up the rarity even higher, without increasing supply. Some examples of this are '[Prime Runes](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/prime_runes)' (Sub50k 'Runescriptions' reinscribed on top of Primes) and '[Planetary Seeds](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/planetaryseeds)' (a collection of mysterious alien seeds reinscribed in the historic block: 876,543)
- **[Planetary Guardians [üëΩ]:](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/planetary_guardians)** Our main PFP collection of 333 alien demigods inscribed on Alpha Uncommon sats, with brute-forced 'Vanity IDs' and on-chain 'mutable' traits. Any Guardian's holder can alter their inscription's 'sat padding' to decide which traits get displayed - altering the look of their Guardian. In this way Guardians are the first 'holder-curated' PFP collection on Ordinals. On top of that our sci-fi game will soon gain the ability to pull on-chain data from all Guardians into the game, making the in-game Guardians display the exact traits chosen by holders, affecting their stats and behaviour. This will effectively turn Guardians holders into 'game masters' - able to affect the mechanics of the most powerful entities in the game, in real time.

All collection holders get early access to game/product releases, and ability to influence the project's direction through feedback and suggestions in holders chat - replicating the standard Patreon/Kickstarter perks without the need to rely on 3rd parties.


# Lore

*Pulses. Frequencies clashing in perfect harmony. 
Projectiles sunder non-carbon based organisms apart, revealing complex fractal structures you recognise from mycelia diagrams.* 

*The path to ultimate understanding of cosmic mysteries is perilous. 
Understanding your fellow adepts is imperative to your ascension.*

*Pale light from the visor illuminates the bullet casing stuck in the life form‚Äôs head, while the ice stalagmites refract the reflections into chromatic aberrations. The Codex has been updated.*

*Theorem‚Äôs knowledge base has been enriched...*

#### Who are 'The Seekers'?
Seekers are a role within a universal organisation called The Theorem whose goal is to understand and formalise knowledge throughout the universe.

Various life-forms can become Seekers, and set off on a lone journey to find and record unknown parts of the universe - however, for this they require Attunement. More on this later.

All knowledge recorded by The Theorem gets recorded in The Codex - a database that Seekers can access at all times and their main interface with the organisation. They can access The Codex through their visors and scan/record/analyse the phenomena they encounter in the universe. 

Seekers are trained in various forms of combat, crafting and diplomacy as they encounter multitudes of situations - desolated mires inhabited by toxic fungi, ice caves with bacteria that have been frozen for millenia or complex political structures of sentient beings living in megalopoli. 

To become a Seeker, you need to learn Attunement - an ability to see and attune yourself to the frequencies of the cosmos and other beings. All Seekers start their journey within the Theorem as Adepts. In teams ranging from 2 to 8, they set out on simpler missions to gather information, train in combat or fix tech issues of Theorem‚Äôs infrastructure across the galaxy. In the process, they also learn meditation and start to understand changes in the frequencies of the universe. When they learn to collaborate and deeply understand each other, they become Attuned and Harmonised. 
After this happens, they are faced with a choice.

Seekers have three options when they reach the end of their training:
- Work for the Theorem in any support role they see fit - the organisation requires technical staff, pilots for their complex spaceships and teleportation devices, chefs, planners, analysts, scribes etc. 
- Choose to leave the company fully - never reaching the same level of harmony and understanding as they‚Äôve felt when Attuning with their fellow Adepts.
- Asecend. Become a Seeker by cleansing yourself of memories and become a perfect vessel for knowledge by being able to fully Attune with whatever you encounter in the universe. Perfect Attunement allows you to feel and see the mathematical structures within the galaxy. Knowledge you share using The Codex will be untainted by the subjective lens of an individual.

#### The story
*You are on a mission. 
Changes in frequencies during your flight to the far reaches of the galaxy were unlike you‚Äôve ever felt. 
They, no - IT called you.*

The Seeker (player character) reached *the planet* (name TBD). 
Covered in a thick layer of ice and snow, the planet is inhabited by few sentient beings which are mostly sheltering within huge caves and cracks between the layers of ice. They are not native to the planet and their attitude towards it varies. Some of them are scientists and inventors, looking for new life forms, technologies or signs of ancient cultures. Others seek financial gain and power - looking for weapons and resources to sell in interplanetary trade.

The primary purpose of The Seeker (player) is to reach the core of the planet - a potential source of some strange energy and unseen mathematical structure that 'called' The Seeker in the opening sequence.
On their way down, The Seeker will encounter various people exploring/inhabiting the planet - some of them are looking to exploit it, some are looking to nourish and take care of it while others worship it.
The planet's temperature rises as the player descends down, resulting in expanding and increasingly complex alien ecosystems of strange and previously undiscovered entities.
