**Liquidium Overview**:
[Liquidium](https://liquidium.fi/) is a pioneering decentralized finance (DeFi) platform specifically designed for Bitcoin lending. Established in 2022 by founders Robin Obermaier, Julian Mezger, and Peter Giammanco, Liquidium operates on the Bitcoin Layer-1 network, focusing on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending using Bitcoin-based assets like Ordinal Inscriptions (Ordinals), Runes, and BRC-20 tokens as collateral. Its mission is to expand liquidity access within the Bitcoin ecosystem while ensuring that all transactions remain non-custodial, secure, and decentralized.[](https://liquidium.fi/blog/bitcoin-borrowing-and-lending-an-overview-of-liquidium)[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/liquidium-fungus-inc/)

**Services Offered**:

1. **Bitcoin Lending and Borrowing**:
   - **[Borrowing](https://app.liquidium.fi/borrow)**: Users can borrow Bitcoin by locking up their Ordinals, Runes, or BRC-20 tokens as collateral. This allows Bitcoin holders to leverage their assets without selling them, retaining ownership and exposure while gaining liquidity. The platform uses Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBTs) and Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) to secure these loans, ensuring that borrowers maintain control over their assets.[](https://liquidium.fi/blog/bitcoin-borrowing-and-lending-an-overview-of-liquidium)[](https://liquidium.fi/blog/liquidium-closes-2-75m-seed-round-to-revolutionize-bitcoin-finance)
   - **[Lending](https://app.liquidium.fi/lend)**: Lenders offer their Bitcoin to borrowers and earn yield on their investments. The system supports earning up to 380% APY for selected collaterals. If a borrower defaults, the lender retains the collateral, providing an additional profit avenue.[](https://liquidium.fi/)

2. **[Runes Swapping](https://app.liquidium.fi/swap)**:
   - Recently, Liquidium introduced a feature allowing users to swap Bitcoin for Runes directly on the platform. This service aims to offer competitive rates through an aggregated liquidity pool, making trading more efficient and rewarding users with additional Amber rewards for using this feature.[](https://x.com/BTCFrontierFund/status/1882963645308805366)

3. **[Custom Loans features](https://app.liquidium.fi/custom-loans/borrow)**:
   - For borrowers with high-value or rare inscriptions, Liquidium offers custom Loans. These are more customizable than standard loans, ideal for unique collections not fitting into standard offers. This feature is still experimental but provides tailored lending solutions for individual needs.[](https://help.liquidium.fi/en/articles/9382778-how-to-do-otc-loans)

4. **[Governance through LIQUIDIUM•TOKEN](https://tokenomics.liquidium.fi/)**:
   - Launched in July 2024, the LIQUIDIUM•TOKEN is a governance token based on the Runes token standard on Bitcoin. This token enables community involvement in platform governance, aiming to decentralize decision-making processes.[](https://liquidium.fi/blog/liquidium-closes-2-75m-seed-round-to-revolutionize-bitcoin-finance)

This includes information on how to lend, borrow, and utilize new features like custom loans.[](https://help.liquidium.fi/en/articles/9187168-overview)[](https://help.liquidium.fi/pt/)

**[Market Presence and Funding](https://liquidium.fi/blog/liquidium-closes-2-75m-seed-round-to-revolutionize-bitcoin-finance)**:
- Liquidium has secured significant funding, with a notable $2.75 million in a seed round, indicating strong investor interest and confidence in its vision to revolutionize Bitcoin finance.

**Future Directions**:
- The company plans to release instant loans on runes, which will be a game changer for borrowers who need access to instant liquidity and for lenders who don’t want to wait until borrowers pick their offers. They will be establishing a Lending Liquidity Pools for fungible tokens and multiple chains (Solana, Ethereum) to aim for broader market penetration, especially in various ecosystems. This expansion, coupled with ongoing innovation in Bitcoin DeFi, positions Liquidium to potentially become a central hub for Bitcoin lending and borrowing, much like Aave in the Ethereum ecosystem.[](https://liquidium.fi/blog/liquidium-closes-2-75m-seed-round-to-revolutionize-bitcoin-finance).
