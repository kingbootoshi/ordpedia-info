# Casey Rodarmor

Casey Rodarmor is an American software developer and cryptocurrency innovator best known for his contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem, particularly for developing the Ordinal Theory and the associated protocols like Ordinals, Inscriptions, and Runes.

## Early Life and Education

- **Birth**: Born in 1983 in California, USA.
- **Background**: Rodarmor comes from a family with a strong literary and technological background; his mother is an author, and his father was an editor for PC World Magazine.
- **Education**: He attended community college before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley, from where he graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in December 2009.

## Career

### Early Career

- **Technology Industry**: Rodarmor started his career in technology in 2010, working for companies like Google. His early work involved various software development projects.

### Bitcoin Contributions

- **Bitcoin Core**: Although not a major contributor, Rodarmor has made some code commits to Bitcoin Core, indicating his involvement in Bitcoin's foundational development.

### Ordinal Theory and Inscriptions

- **Conception**: In 2022, Rodarmor began working on a numbering scheme for satoshis, leading to the creation of **Ordinal Theory**. This theory allows each satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) to be uniquely identified and tracked, enabling the creation of Bitcoin-native non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through inscriptions.
  - **Inscriptions**: These are essentially data (like images, text, or video) attached to individual satoshis, making each one a unique digital artifact. This process was facilitated by previous Bitcoin upgrades like SegWit and Taproot.
  - **Launch**: Ordinal Theory and the first inscription were introduced to the public in January 2023, marking the advent of Bitcoin Ordinals.

- **Impact**: Rodarmor's work with Ordinals has been both celebrated for bringing new life and use cases to Bitcoin and criticized for potentially increasing transaction fees and network congestion.

### Runes Protocol

- **Development**: Following the success of Ordinals, Casey announced another innovation, the **Runes Protocol**, in late 2023. 
  - **Purpose**: Runes aim to simplify the creation of fungible tokens on Bitcoin, akin to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum but designed to be more efficient and less likely to produce "junk" UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs).
  - **Launch**: Runes were scheduled to launch during the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, with the goal of adding another layer of functionality to Bitcoin's blockchain.

### Community and Influence

- **SF Bitcoin BitDevs**: Rodarmor co-hosted this meetup group in San Francisco, which focuses on the technical aspects of Bitcoin. This role underscored his commitment to fostering Bitcoin development and community engagement.
- **Recognition**: In 2023, CoinDesk named Casey Rodarmor as one of the most influential people in the cryptocurrency space, specifically for his work on Ordinals.

## Controversies and Debates

- **Ordinals Debate**: Rodarmor's introduction of Ordinals sparked significant debate within the Bitcoin community. Some view it as an exciting evolution for Bitcoin, while others see it as a deviation from Bitcoin's original purpose, potentially leading to network bloat and higher fees.
- **Philosophical Stance**: Known for his belief in Bitcoin's potential to resist governmental control, Rodarmor often emphasizes the importance of Bitcoin's security and applications remaining true to this ethos.

## Personal Life

- **Interests**: Apart from his technical work, Rodarmor has expressed an interest in generative art, which influenced his work on Ordinals.
- **Public Persona**: He describes himself as an artist at heart, despite his deep involvement in technology, showcasing a blend of creativity and technical prowess.

## Legacy and Future Work

Rodarmor's contributions have significantly altered the landscape of what's possible with Bitcoin, extending its functionality beyond mere currency to a platform for digital art and collectibles. His work continues to evolve, with potential implications for how Bitcoin might integrate further into broader blockchain technology trends.
