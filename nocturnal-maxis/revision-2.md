## About

Nocturnal Maxis was a free mint on 15 Aug 2023, inscribed on Bitcoin blockchain by [Mr BRC](https://x.com/MrBRC0). All the sats are inscribed on Palindromes, some of which are vintage and 1 being a nakamoto sat.

There are total of 7 different traits.

This project is so community driven, all the traits are named after the community members immortalized on Bitcoin.

## Day and Night

Nocturnal Maxis is the first project to have different presentation of time within the ordinal itself. Depending on the system clock, it will have 3 different displays.

## Rarities
There are different rarities based on the traits and sat. Nakamoto Palindrome being the rarest, 2nd of its kind to be inscribed. Vintage Palindromes, Paliblock Palindromes and normal Palindromes.

The official traits rarity can be found in the official website. Some time in late 2024, a few ordinals which contains the MacDonalds Cap were being asked to be removed as MagicEden received complaints from MacDonalds. I believe these are now the collectibles.
