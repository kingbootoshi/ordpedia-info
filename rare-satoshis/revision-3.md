# Rare Sats

Rare Sats refer to uniquely identified satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshis), that are considered valuable or collectible due to their distinct attributes, historical significance, or scarcity. The concept of Rare Sats emerged with the introduction of the Ordinals protocol, which allows each satoshi to be assigned a sequential number and inscribed with metadata, creating a new layer of individuality within Bitcoin's otherwise fungible ecosystem.

## The Rodarmor Rarity Index
The Rodarmor Rarity Index, developed as a framework to classify Rare Sats, categorizes satoshis based on their occurrence within Bitcoin's block production and protocol milestones. The levels of rarity are:

- **Common:** Any sat that is not the first in its block.
- **Uncommon:** The first sat of each block.
- **Rare:** The first sat of each difficulty adjustment period (every 2,016 blocks).
- **Epic:** The first sat of each halving epoch (every 210,000 blocks).
- **Legendary:** The first sat of each cycle (every six halvings).
- **Mythic:** The first sat of the Genesis Block.

These classifications provide a hierarchy of collectibility and guide enthusiasts in identifying and valuing Rare Sats.

## Black Satoshis Classification
In contrast to the Rodarmor classifications, which focus on the first satoshi of a period, the Black Satoshis classification highlights the last satoshi of each corresponding period:

- **Black Uncommon:** The last sat of each block.
- **Black Rare:** The last sat of each difficulty adjustment period (every 2,016 blocks).
- **Black Epic:** The last sat of each halving epoch (every 210,000 blocks).
- **Black Legendary:** The last sat of each cycle (every six halvings).
- **Black Mythic:** The last sat of the Genesis Block.

## Exotic Sats and Satributes
In addition to the Rodarmor and Black classifications, certain satoshis are deemed "exotic" due to unique attributes or historical connections. These characteristics, termed "satributes," include:

- **Palindrome Sats:** Satoshis with a numerical ID that reads the same backward and forward (e.g., 1234321).
- **Alpha Sats:** The very first satoshi in a Bitcoin.
- **Omega Sats:** The very last satoshi in a Bitcoin.
- **Vintage Sats:** Satoshis mined during Bitcoin's early days, such as those from the first 1,000 blocks.
- **Pizza Sats:** Satoshis involved in the famous 10,000 BTC pizza transaction in 2010.
- **Nakamoto Sats**: Satoshis from blocks that were mined and spent by Satoshi Nakamoto.
- **First Transaction Sats**: Satoshis involved in the first ever Bitcoin transaction, from Satoshi to Hal Finney in January 2009.
- **Hitman Sats**: Satoshis involved in the transaction sent by Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR) to hire a hitman. 
- **Block 9 Sats**: Satoshis mined in block 9, a block mined by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, which makes them some of the oldest sats in circulation.
- **Block 78 Sats**: Satoshis mined in block 78, the first block that was mined by someone other than Satoshi.

These exotic sats are sought after by collectors for their storytelling potential and perceived rarity.

## Collecting Rare Sats
Rare Sats have given rise to a community of collectors known as "Sat Hunters" and "Rare Sat Collectors". The ability to inscribe data onto sats through Ordinals further enhances their value, blending digital art, historical significance, and financial utility.

## Significance and Market Impact
Rare Sats represent a novel asset class within Bitcoin, challenging the traditional notion of fungibility. They introduce a collectible dimension to the Bitcoin ecosystem, attracting investors, enthusiasts, and artists. This emerging market could potentially bridge the gap between blockchain technology and cultural expression, expanding Bitcoin's use cases and appeal.
