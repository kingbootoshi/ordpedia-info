The Wizards of Ord is an initiative that aims to drive the Ordinals space forward through technical contributions, education and onboarding artists and builders.

It was founded by @lifofifo who builds tooling to make art, transactions and learning on Bitcoin so much faster, easier and better.

3,333 ordinal wizards were inscribed exclusively on the historic block 78 sats.

The initiative builds quality products for Ordinals and Bitcoin that benefit the whole space, as: 
* Rune Blaster: Fully self-custodial batch minting tool for Runes. Minting Runes done the right way.
* Inscribe: Self custodial inscribing tool, primarily focused on solo inscriptions and exposing all the protocol features.
* TX Manager: Speed up or cancel pending transactions, manage UTXOs, and more!
* MagicPool: Real-time overview of secondary sales in Mempool, with a chance to RBF snipe.

It was created and is taken care of by a well-versed team of web3 professionals. At the forefront of pioneering Ordinals and Runes revolution on Bitcoin.
