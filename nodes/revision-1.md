**What is a Bitcoin node** 

A Bitcoin node is a computer that runs Bitcoin software, connecting to the Bitcoin network and acting as a participant by validating and relaying transactions, essentially ensuring the integrity and consensus of the blockchain by verifying that each transaction adheres to the network's rules; in simpler terms, it's a computer that stores a complete copy of the Bitcoin blockchain and helps maintain its accuracy by checking every transaction against the network's rules.

**Key points about Bitcoin nodes:**

**Function:**
They verify the validity of new transactions and blocks before adding them to the blockchain. 

**Decentralization:**
By having many nodes spread across the network, there is no single point of control, making Bitcoin decentralized. 

**Types of nodes:**

1. **Full node:** Downloads and stores the entire blockchain, validating every transaction. 

1. **Lightweight node:** Relies on full nodes to verify transactions, requiring less storage space. 

**Importance:**
Running a Bitcoin node allows users to independently verify the blockchain and contribute to the network's security.
