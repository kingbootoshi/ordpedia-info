The first 10K Original Generative Collection On Bitcoin

Honey Badgers is a generative 10k PFP collection inscribed on the Bitcoin Blockchain through Ordinals. It is an experiment to see if a native NFT community can emerge and thrive on the native Bitcoin ecosystem. The project doesnâ€™t have a roadmap and its solely purpose is to deliver high quality pixelated art and a fun place to hang out with friends. The collection is Bitcoin themed with the honey badger meme being the center of it, but also has many other traits related to crypto and specifically the Bitcoin culture.

**History**

Created by [Akva](https://x.com/Akva556) (Founder) and [Robrigo](https://x.com/DesenhistaRedn)(Artist), Honey Badgers or HB in short, started inscribing February 14, 2023. The Inscription range starts with #81,557 and ends #1,026,518. 
The inspiration behind the collection comes from one of the earliest Bitcoin memes, from 2012. Back then,  Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin adopter, placed a billboard in Santa Clara, California, featuring the honey badger with the caption "Bitcoin The Honey Badger Of Money." This event is often cited as one of the first significant uses of the honey badger as a symbol for Bitcoin's tenacity. 

Inscribing went slow and the team decided to do a 1:1 badger airdrop to all minters so everyone got one free for each minted. 

**August 2023**: The Solscription (SOLS) project officially launches. It marks the debut as the first to utilize the SPL-20 token standard on the Solana blockchain. This innovation allows SOLS tokens to be seamlessly converted between inscriptions and SPL tokens using a Solana-native two-way bridge. Honey Badgers, known degens and very savvy blockchain users, realised how to mint. On a marathon that took 12 hours, the Badger Den, minted SOLS, allowing everyone to mint for less than $3(USD) and when the market opened, sold for minimum 3 SOL (300USD at the time). Some HB minted so many that had still a few to sell at the ATH - 110 SOL.

**December 2023**: NodeMonkes offically launched their collection, claiming to be the first 10k Ordinal collection. This started a discussion between Honey Badgers and Nodemonkes, with Bagders claiming "First is First" and Monkes claiming they fully inscribed the entire collection with a range #83,522 to 111,319.
This discussion is still ongoing. 

**December 7, 2023**, [Inscription #8](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/item-details/d95c0fb86bc0f0dce6a732c5ab77d47e33ed24099bdb01133f768cef75a47724i0) sells for 10.4 BTC. Immediatelly Honey Badgers, on a crazy stunt move, add the Honey Badger to the 10k official collection and made the [headlines](https://decrypt.co/209032/early-bitcoin-ordinals-art-sells-for-record-450000). This early Inscription was bought by OgGeneral, a Bitcoin whale and collector.
