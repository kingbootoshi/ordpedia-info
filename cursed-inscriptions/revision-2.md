**Cursed Inscriptions on Bitcoin: An Overview**

**What Are Cursed Inscriptions?**

Cursed inscriptions, also known as "Cursed Ordinals," are a unique subset of Bitcoin Ordinals. Ordinals are essentially NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain where each satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) can be inscribed with data to create unique digital artifacts. Cursed inscriptions are those that were not initially recognized or indexed by the Ordinals protocol due to various issues or bugs, leading to them receiving negative numbers instead of the sequential positive ones assigned to regular inscriptions.

**Origins:**

- **Discovery**: The term "cursed inscriptions" emerged after developers noticed that certain inscriptions, due to bugs or improper use of opcodes (operation codes used in Bitcoin scripting), weren't being acknowledged by the Ordinals protocol. This was particularly evident when the protocol launched in an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) state in January 2023.

- **Negative Numbering**: To address these unrecognized inscriptions without disrupting the existing numbering system, Casey Rodarmor, the creator of Ordinals, proposed the concept of "cursed" or "negative" inscriptions. These receive numbers that count down, starting from -1, rather than up like regular inscriptions.

**Characteristics:**

- **Invisibility**: Initially, these inscriptions were invisible to wallets, marketplaces, and explorers because they weren't indexed. This made them 'cursed' or invalid in the eyes of the Ordinals protocol.

- **Rarity**: With the resolution of these issues through protocol updates, the supply of cursed inscriptions became fixed, making them a finite and potentially rare category of Ordinals. 

- **Trading and Value**: After the Ordinals protocol was updated to version 0.6.0 in June 2023, these inscriptions were recognized, allowing them to be traded. Their uniqueness and scarcity have led some collectors to view them as valuable.

**Technical Details:**

- **Creation**: Cursed inscriptions were created through several means, including:
  - Multiple inscriptions in one transaction.
  - Inscriptions on inputs after the first.
  - Multiple inscriptions on the same satoshi.
  - Use of unsupported or even-numbered opcodes like OP_66.

- **Resolution**: The Ordinals protocol has since been updated to recognize these inscriptions, transitioning them from being "cursed" to "blessed", where they receive positive numbers at a specific block height known as "Jubilee", which was set to occur on January 5, 2024.

**Cultural Impact:**

- **Collectors' Items**: There's been a rush to inscribe or collect these "cursed" items, especially those with numbers close to -10,000, mirroring the value placed on early numbered regular inscriptions.

- **Market Dynamics**: Cursed inscriptions have created a niche market within the Ordinals ecosystem, with platforms like Magic Eden recognizing and trading them, although their volume remains a small portion of the overall market.

- **Speculation and Debate**: The community has had mixed reactions, with some seeing it as an opportunity for unique collectibles, while others debate the implications for the Ordinals protocol's integrity and future development.

**Future Considerations:**

- **Potential Scarcity**: Since no new cursed inscriptions can be created post-Jubilee, existing ones might appreciate in value due to their limited supply.

- **Integration**: As the Bitcoin Ordinals ecosystem evolves, how these inscriptions are integrated or treated by wallets, marketplaces, and the broader community will shape their future role and value.

- **Technological Evolution**: The handling of cursed inscriptions has highlighted the need for careful management of protocol changes to maintain stability while accommodating new features or fixing bugs.

In summary, cursed inscriptions are an intriguing aspect of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, characterized by their initial oversight, unique numbering system, and the subsequent community and market dynamics they've spurred. They serve as both a lesson in the complexities of protocol development and an example of how errors can become valuable in the digital asset space.[](https://medium.com/%40Piperazzis/the-wonders-of-cursed-inscriptions-in-the-bitcoin-ordinals-ecosystem-cf1b52967fd2)[](https://www.gate.io/learn/articles/what-are-cursed-inscriptions/1472)[](https://decrypt.co/212908/mysterious-ordinals-inscription-teases-cursed-bitcoin-art-project)
