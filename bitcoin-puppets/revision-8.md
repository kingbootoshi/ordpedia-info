**What are Bitcoin Puppets ?**
- Bitcoin Puppets is a Bitcoin Ordinals collection featuring 10,001 hand-drawn MS Paint monkeys depicted in edgy, irreverent scenarios.

 
- Launched in January 2024, the collection expands on the O.P.I.U.M project and embraces a counterculture ethos. Itâ€™s designed as a satirical nod to popular projects like NodeMonkes and Bitcoin Frogs, breaking away from the norms of traditional collectibles.

- True to its rebellious spirit, Bitcoin Puppets offers no roadmap, copyright, utility, or guarantees. According to their website, the collection is meant purely as art and not to be taken seriously, serving as a playful critique of the broader Ordinals ecosystem.
