10,000 generative frogs on Bitcoin minted via the Lightning Network.

Launched on March 8 2023, Bitcoin Frogs are 10,000 generative digital collectibles with proof of ownership and immutably stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. No more will ever be created. Rarities of all traits within each layer are equal, allowing subjective appreciation of aesthetics and Satoshi-based rarities to emerge. The project that onboarded many people back to Daddy chain Bitcoin via it's free and fair mint, no royalties, no utilities and all for good fun and vibes, ribbit!  
Bitcoin Frogs is one of the earliest profile-picture (PFP) ordinals project on Bitcoin. Every frog is inscribed onto a Satoshi that can be tracked via the Ordinal Theory protocol.
