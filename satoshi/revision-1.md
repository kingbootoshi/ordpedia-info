# Satoshi

Satoshi is the smallest unit of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, named in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or group credited with the creation of Bitcoin.

## Definition

A Satoshi is equivalent to one hundred millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001 BTC). Given that one bitcoin is divisible up to eight decimal places, this makes the Satoshi the smallest unit of the Bitcoin currency.

### Conversion

- 1 Bitcoin (BTC) = 100,000,000 Satoshis
- 1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC

## Purpose

The creation of the Satoshi denomination allows for microtransactions within the Bitcoin network, where even very small amounts of value can be transferred. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where the value of Bitcoin is high, making whole bitcoins impractical for small transactions.

## Usage

- **Microtransactions**: Satoshis enable transactions of very small amounts, which can be beneficial for tipping, donations, or payments for low-cost digital goods.
- **Precision in Transactions**: The divisibility to Satoshis provides precision in trading and financial applications, allowing for exact pricing and value transfer without rounding errors.

## Cultural Impact

- **Naming**: The term "Satoshi" not only denotes a unit of currency but also carries symbolic weight within the cryptocurrency community, celebrating the innovation of Bitcoin's creator.
- **Mining**: Miners occasionally earn rewards in Satoshis when the block reward becomes small enough. As of certain halving events, the block reward can be less than one full bitcoin, thus distributed in Satoshis.

## Economic Considerations

- **Inflation and Deflation**: The fixed supply of Bitcoin means that as the currency's value increases, the practical utility of Satoshis also increases, allowing Bitcoin to remain a viable currency even at high valuations.
- **Fiat Comparison**: Unlike many fiat currencies where the smallest unit might be a cent or similar, Bitcoin's smallest practical unit is significantly smaller, providing a different economic dynamic for handling money.

## Technical Details

- **Blockchain**: Transactions in Satoshis are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, where all transactions are logged with high precision.
- **Software Support**: Wallets and exchange platforms generally support transactions in Satoshis, though user interfaces might display values in BTC for simplicity.

## Related Terms

- **Bitcoin**: The primary cryptocurrency where Satoshi is a unit.
- **Cryptocurrency**: Digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security.
- **Blockchain**: A distributed database used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, secured from tampering and revision.
