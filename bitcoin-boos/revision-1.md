## Lore

Bitcoin Boos comprise 101 charming pixel characters known as "Boos" residing on the Bitcoin blockchain. Their home, "The Boo Kingdom," is a magical wonderland filled with vibrant pixel art where each Boo has their own unique personality and story.

The kingdom is led by twin rulers: Bootoshi (in red) and Blootoshi (in blue). While both share leadership duties, Bootoshi holds the distinction of being Quest Boo's creator. The Boo Kingdom is specifically located in block 775087, Bootoshi's birthplace, which manifests as a medieval fantasy RPG world complete with monsters, adventures, quests, dungeons, and various kingdoms.

The Boottalion serves as the kingdom's warrior army, with each Genesis Boo commanding their own squadrants that mirror their power and appearance. These warriors are distinguished by their Octahedron shape and Rayman-inspired detached hands and feet.

*Important Note: Despite their name, Boos are not ghosts!*
