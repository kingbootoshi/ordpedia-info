# 📚 Ordpedia Info Archive

This repository serves as an automated, public archive of all approved pages from [Ordpedia](https://www.ordpedia.com). It acts as a decentralized backup of Ordpedia's knowledge base, ensuring that this valuable information remains accessible to the community even if the main website experiences downtime.

## 🔄 How It Works

This repository automatically syncs with Ordpedia's content through a dedicated service that:

1. Monitors for newly approved pages and revisions on Ordpedia
2. Creates a new folder for each page using its slug as the folder name
3. Stores each approved revision as a markdown file (e.g., `revision-1.md`, `revision-2.md`, etc.)
4. Automatically updates when pages are renamed or new revisions are approved

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
ordpedia-info/
├── page-slug-1/
│   ├── revision-1.md
│   └── revision-2.md
├── page-slug-2/
│   └── revision-1.md
└── ...
```

Each folder represents a page from Ordpedia, and each markdown file within represents an approved revision of that page.
