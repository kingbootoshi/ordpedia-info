## Ordinal Eggs - Sub10k


**What Are Ordinal Eggs?**

Ordinal Eggs are a collection of 100 digital collectibles inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain, using ordinal theory to embed unique attributes onto satoshis. The project stands out for its focus on being among the first inscriptions on Ordinals.

**How It All Started**

Ordinal Eggs was created in February 2023 by two friends, Hammad and Aiden. With a vision to bring art and collectibles to the Bitcoin ecosystem, they began with a small collection of 100 eggs, all inscribed within first 6k inscriptions on Ordinals. From those humble beginnings, the project grew steadily, expanding its community and collections over time.

In just two years, Ordinal Eggs has grown from a handful of holders (90 to be exact) to a vibrant community of over 3,000 collectors. The project’s focus on early inscriptions and limited supply has made it a significant player in the growing world of Bitcoin-based NFTs.

**Our Sub-Collections**

As the project evolved, so did its creative output, resulting in a variety of unique sub-collections:

- **Mutant Eggs:** 200 eggs inscribed on sub-600k inscriptions, expanding the concept of the original eggs.
- **Cursed Eggs:** 26 eggs inscribed on sub-100k inscriptions, created as part of the cursed inscriptions meta.
- **Donuts Dynasty:** 44 eggs inscribed on early block 9 sats, created during the rare sats meta.
- **Mothercluckers:** 10,000 Cluckers with interactive and recursive inscriptions, introduced when recursion was intoduced in January 2024.



The team also developed **SwapSats**, a platform aimed at improving the experience of trading Ordinals and Runes, further solidifying their commitment to the growth of the Ordinals ecosystem.

**Our Commitment**

We’re focused on:

- **Innovation:** We keep pushing the limits of creative concepts within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
- **Community:** Building and nurturing a passionate and engaged community of collectors.
- **Sustainability:** Growing the project steadily, ensuring it remains impactful and valuable for years to come.
