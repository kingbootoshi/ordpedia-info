# Explanation, Sort Of
FVKATS are like, these tiny digital cats living on Bitcoin. There's 10,000 of 'em, and their job is to do absolutely nothing except maybe make you question your life choices. They exist to be the digital equivalent of a whoopee cushion at a fancy dinner party.

# Mind Melting Effects
They're trying to turn Bitcoin into a playground where the slides are made of spaghetti code and the swings are just there to confuse you.

# Their purpose?
To make you think, "Did I just see a flying pig or was that a FVKAT?"

# Technicalish
Each FVKAT is a speck of Bitcoin wearing a tiny party hat, and they've all signed a guest book in the blockchain's attic.

It's like someone took the idea of digital art, mixed it with a blender, and then threw the result onto Bitcoin for shits and giggles.

# The Crowd and the Chaos
The people into FVKATS are probably the ones who giggle at the thought of Bitcoin being used for anything other than serious business.
They're here to watch the world burn, but like, in a fun, "Oops, I spilled my cereal" kind of way.
