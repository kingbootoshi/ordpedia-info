### Runes

**Runes** refer to a new token protocol introduced on the Bitcoin blockchain, conceptualized and developed by Casey Rodarmor, who is also known for creating the Ordinals protocol. Here's a detailed explanation of Runes:

#### Definition and Purpose

- **Fungible Tokens on Bitcoin**: Runes are designed to facilitate the creation and management of fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin network. Unlike Ordinals, which focus on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by inscribing data onto individual satoshis, Runes aim to provide a simple, efficient way for users to issue interchangeable tokens.

- **UTXO-Based System**: Runes leverage Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model. This means each token operation (creation, minting, transferring) is based on how Bitcoin transactions work, ensuring compatibility and efficiency within Bitcoin's existing framework.

#### How Runes Work

- **Etching**: The process of creating a new Rune token is called "etching." During etching, properties like the token's name, divisibility, supply, and minting terms are defined. Once etched, these properties are immutable.

- **Minting**: After etching, tokens can be minted according to the set terms. Minting involves generating the pre-defined amount of Runes, similar to how one would mint traditional cryptocurrency tokens.

- **Transferring**: Runes are transferred through Bitcoin transactions, utilizing the UTXO system. Each transaction can specify how many Runes are moved from one UTXO to another, ensuring the tokens remain trackable and secure.

- **Runestones**: These are protocol messages stored in Bitcoin transaction outputs, specifically within the OP_RETURN field. Runestones contain all the necessary data for Rune operations like etching, minting, or transferring.

#### Key Features and Benefits

- **Efficiency**: By integrating with Bitcoin's UTXO model, Runes aim to be more efficient than previous token standards like BRC-20, which can lead to network congestion due to "junk" UTXOs.

- **Simplicity**: The protocol is designed to be straightforward, requiring less complexity compared to other token protocols on Bitcoin, making it more accessible to users and developers.

- **Security**: Since Runes operate directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, they inherit its security model, including Bitcoin's robust consensus mechanism and network security.

- **Compatibility**: Runes are compatible with existing Bitcoin infrastructure, including wallets and the Lightning Network, potentially increasing the utility and adoption of Bitcoin for various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

#### Launch and Impact

- **Activation with Halving**: Runes were launched at the same time as the Bitcoin halving in April 2024, at block 840,000, to coincide with this significant event, thereby gaining substantial attention and causing a spike in transaction fees due to the rush of new token issuances.

- **Market Cap and Projects**: Shortly after launch, millions of Runes were minted, with the total market cap surpassing $1 billion, showcasing significant early adoption. Notable projects include meme coins like DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON and utility tokens for various purposes.

#### Conclusion

Runes represent an evolution in how tokens can be issued and managed on Bitcoin, leveraging its native blockchain features to create a more efficient, user-friendly token standard. As the ecosystem around Runes grows, it could potentially reshape the landscape of what's possible on Bitcoin, from meme coins to more sophisticated DeFi applications.
